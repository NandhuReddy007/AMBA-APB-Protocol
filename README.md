# AMBA-APB-Protocol
This repository contains an implementation of the AMBA APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol in Verilog/SystemVerilog. APB is a simple, low-power, and low-bandwidth bus used to connect peripheral devices in SoC designs. It is part of the ARM AMBA protocol family and is typically used for register access in peripherals.
